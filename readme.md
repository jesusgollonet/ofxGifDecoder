# ofxGifDecoder

Decode animated gif files in openframeworks. 

![gif palette extraction example](http://ofxgif.jesusgollonet.com/img/gifdecoder.jpg)

Includes a simple example tested with openframeworks 0.8.1

Functionality is still very scarce. You can:

- draw individual frames, 
- get frame duration info, 
- get the gif palette, etc.

If you like this, you will probably enjoy [ofxGifEncoder](https://github.com/jesusgollonet/ofxGifEncoder) too.
They'll end up living together as ofxGif at some point.
